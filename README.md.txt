# Grocery Store Simulator 🛒

This is my first personal C# project — a simple **console-based grocery store simulator** written just to practice and understand the basics of C#.  
Built "on the knee", with love and curiosity — nothing too serious, just a way to explore programming in a fun and hands-on way.

## Features
- 🛍 View categories and products
- ⚖ Choose items by quantity or weight
- 🧾 Add to cart and see total price
- 💵 Prices displayed in USD
- 📦 Organized product categories (Dairy, Meat, Snacks, Drinks, etc.)

## Why I made this
I'm currently learning C# and this is one of my first real attempts to write something from scratch.  
This project helped me get a better understanding of:
- how to structure code
- classes and objects
- collections and loops
- real-world logic (shopping logic!)

## Run it
This is a console app — just build and run from Visual Studio or `dotnet run`.
